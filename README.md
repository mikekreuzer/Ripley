# Ripley

## reddit programming languages index

Ripley ranks redditâ€™s programming language subreddits by number of subscribers -- to see which [languages programmers are talking about this month][site].

This repo holds the script used to scrape reddit.

## To do:

- account for ties (currently done manually)
- tests
- add a rake script to: run this, move the generated files to the Zine repo, and run Zine
- run the Rake task monthly via cron
